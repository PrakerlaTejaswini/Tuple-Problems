# Tuple-Problems
Tuples in Python
A tuple is an immutable data structure in Python that is used to store multiple items in a single variable.
 When to Use Tuples?
✔ When you need read-only data.
✔ When you want to use it as a dictionary key (since tuples are hashable).
✔ When you need a faster alternative to lists
In Python, a **tuple** is an immutable and ordered collection of elements, meaning its values cannot be changed after creation. It is defined using parentheses `()` and can store elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, and floats. Tuples are commonly used when data should remain constant, offering faster performance compared to lists. Key operations include **indexing, slicing, packing, unpacking, and built-in methods like `count()` and `index()`** to retrieve information efficiently.
